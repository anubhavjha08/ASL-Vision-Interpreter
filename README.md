# **ASL-Vision-Interpreter**

This project focuses on detecting and interpreting hand signs for the first three letters of the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet: **A**, **B**, and **C**. Using computer vision techniques, the model identifies these basic ASL hand gestures from video or image inputs, making it a simple and effective tool for ASL learners or anyone interested in sign language detection.

## **Key Features:**
- **Real-time Detection**: Uses computer vision algorithms to recognize ASL signs for the letters **A**, **B**, and **C**.
- **Easy Integration**: Designed for easy deployment and integration into various applications.
- **Educational Tool**: Perfect for beginners learning the fundamentals of ASL.

## **Technologies Used:**
- **OpenCV** for image and video processing
- **Mediapipe**
- **Python** for overall code implementation
